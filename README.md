# ToDo:

-Webpack needs some configuring, production build not quite automated yet

# Database setup

Modify SQLBatch with your local sql server name (atm localhost) 

# Backend setup

Start the project in Visual Studio and press F5

# Frontend setup

run npm install & npm Start (npm run build for production build)

## [Demo](http://ng2booking.azurewebsites.net)

###Demo database might not have any available reservations set.
###If you happen to open up the demo after it's been in-active for a while, it takes 3-10 seconds for the backend to wake up. 
###That's why it takes a while sometimes to see which dates are still reservable
